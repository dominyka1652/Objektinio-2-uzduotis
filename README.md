2. g++ -o main v0.5vector.main.o v0.5vector.o (or v0.5list.main.0 v0.5list.o / v0.5deque.main.o v0.5deque.o)
3. main.exe
###
1. The program asks you if you want to create files (write "sukurti") or not (write "nenoriu")
2. If you choose yes:
    - enter the number of files you want to generate
    - enter the number of sudents
    - enter the number of homeworks
    - enter "vidurki" if you want to get the average or enter "mediana" if you want to get median.   
    - if you choose more ten 1 file, then the program asks you to enter everything that is mentioned from b)
3. If you choose no:
    - enter "ivesti" if you want to input data manually or enter "nuskaityti" if you want to read from a file:
